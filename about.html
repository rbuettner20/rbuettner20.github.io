            <h2> Before College </h2>
            <p>
                I'm <i>terrible</i> at writing about myself, but hopefully that won't affect my grade! I was born and
                raised in Holdrege, Nebraska, a small town with a population of roughly 5,000. I grew up with an older
                sister and and older brother, both of which I am still extremely close with. In high school I
                participated in as many sports as I could: basketball, track, football, and baseball during the summer,
                which was my absolute favorite. It was also during high school that I really discovered my love for
                working with technology, having built custom PC's for me and a few friends. I also ran a little "IT help"
                service for my neighborhood, mostly servicing elderly people confused with iPhones or other newer devices!
            </p>
            <h2> Hobbies and Fun </h2>
            <p>
                My free time is spent in a variety of ways, some much less productive than the others. My go-to time
                killer is playing video games with my friends. Most of my friends have moved out of state, along with
                my older brother, so keeping in touch with them while playing video games really helps staying in each
                others' lives! I also love to keep in shape by running, but during this time of the year it's hard to
                find the motivation to brave the cold weather, so I don't do it as frequently at the moment. Whenever my
                girlfriend comes to visit, she usually has ideas of fun recipes or little craft projects that are a lot
                of fun to do. I'm terrible at cooking, but it usually goes a lot better when she's helping me! Recently,
                I've started to get into 3D printing. It's been really interesting trying to come up with ways to use it,
                and I've already printed a few things that are actually helpful around the house!
