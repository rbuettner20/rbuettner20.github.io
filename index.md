                Hello, Dr. Royce, and anyone else who happens to view this page! I've created this site not only to meet
                the requirements for Activity 2, but also to relay a bit of information about myself. I am currently a
                senior here at UNO, on track to graduate in Fall 2020. I'm studying for my Bachelor's in MIS, which has
                proven to be a great fit for me, as both IT and business intrigue me! My second "About Me" page will go
                more in-depth about me and my life.
            </p>

                It's been about two years since I took Intro to Web Development, and I haven't really been practicing
                the skills I'd learned during that class, so trying to relearn a lot of HTML and CSS rules is going to
                take some time. However, I'm very interested in this topic, so refreshing myself on it is going to be
                somewhat enjoyable! I'm really looking forward to this class and learning even more about web development!
